# AppStore-rating-prediction
My project for SSA contest (11th grade)

Hello there! 
This is my entry for the SSA contest that is going to take place in the next month or two. 
It is a machine learning project, and I chose the AppStore dataset which helps to determine whether the app is going to be successful or not.
That's all for now. I'm probably going to translate it in English later, but for now it is in Russian. See ya! :)
